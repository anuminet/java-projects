A collection of Java programs I've written, ranging from console applications to a GUI game.

## Projects

### Bank Account
A console-based banking app called **BigBank**. On launch it creates randomized checking and savings accounts for you. You can:
- View account statements
- Deposit and withdraw funds
- Transfer money between checking and savings

**Concepts used:** Classes and objects, encapsulation, exception handling, `Scanner`

---

### Grade Calculator
Enter grades one at a time for any subject and get a full results summary including:
- Average score and letter grade (A–F)
- Highest and lowest scores
- Total number of grades entered

**Concepts used:** `ArrayList`, loops, input validation, static methods

---

### Number Guessing Game
A classic guessing game where the computer picks a random number between 1 and 100. The game gives higher/lower hints after each guess, tracks how many attempts it took, and lets you play again when finished.

**Concepts used:** `Random`, loops, input validation

---

### Pizza Program
An interactive pizza ordering system for **Pizza Plaza**. Choose from:
- 4 sizes (8", 14", 16", 18")
- 4 crust types (Thin, Deep Dish, Regular, Stuffed)
- Up to 10 toppings from a set menu
- Optional extra cheese

Automatically calculates and displays the total price.

**Concepts used:** Classes, arrays, loops, input validation

---

### Snake Game
A graphical game built with **Java Swing**. You are a player trapped in a dark grid who must find a hidden exit trapdoor while avoiding an invisible snake that hunts you. Every 3 moves, a "voice from above" gives directional hints toward the exit and warns you if the snake is nearby.

- Arrow keys to move
- Press `D` to toggle debug mode and reveal hidden entities
- Press `Space` to restart after game over

**Concepts used:** Inheritance, abstract classes, polymorphism, composition, Swing GUI, `KeyListener`, OOP design patterns

### Practice
Miscellaneous practice files written while learning Java.
